# Plan settings

## When to skip a plan
- The user explicitly asks not to create a plan.
- The task is a small, single-step change (for example: a minor typo/doc fix or updating one value) and you are confident it does not need coordination across files.

## When to share a plan
- The work spans multiple steps, files, or design decisions.
- You need to investigate failures or reproduce an issue before fixing it.
- Anything that would benefit from outlining validations or tests ahead of execution.

## How to structure the plan
- Keep the plan concise (about 3–6 bullet points), with no nested lists.
- Capture high-level steps only; avoid detailed commands or code.
- Include a validation/test step when applicable.
- If the approach changes materially, update the plan and call it out.
