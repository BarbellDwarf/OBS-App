# Hotkeys Implementation Plan

- [x] Add renderer-level keyboard listener for Ctrl/Cmd shortcuts
- [x] Map number keys 1-9 to scenes using the visible order in the scenes list
- [x] Toggle streaming with Ctrl/Cmd + S and recording with Ctrl/Cmd + R
- [x] Guard against triggering shortcuts while typing or when disconnected
- [x] Document the available shortcuts for users
